## üîßOptimizations
This project implements performance optimizations to ensure a smooth user experience. 

### Key Optimizations

1. **State Management:**
   - useMemo for derived states to prevent unnecessary re-renders
   - useReducer for efficient cart operations
   - Optimized component re-rendering patterns

2. **Data & Performance:**
- Smart Caching: Product data cached with timestamp validation
- Debounced Search: Smooth search experience without excessive API calls
- Code Splitting: Dynamic imports with React.lazy for reduced initial bundle
- Virtualized Rendering: Infinite scroll for large product lists

3. **Persistence & UX:**
- Local Storage Integration: Cart and filter preferences persist across sessions
- Neurodesign Principles: I implemented visual hierarchy by making product titles larger than descriptions and using contrasting colors for price and 'Add to Cart' buttons to draw attention to key decision points

For detailed information about the optimizations, refer to the Optimization Review file.
