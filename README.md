üîßOptimizations
This project implements performance optimizations to ensure a smooth user experience. 

Key Optimizations

State Management
useReducer for efficient cart operations
useMemo for derived states to prevent unnecessary re-renders
Optimized component re-rendering patterns

Data & Performance
Smart Caching: Product data cached with timestamp validation
Debounced Search: Smooth search experience without excessive API calls
Code Splitting: Dynamic imports with React.lazy for reduced initial bundle
Virtualized Rendering: Infinite scroll for large product lists

Persistence & UX
Local Storage Integration: Cart and filter preferences persist across sessions
Neurodesign Principles: I implemented visual hierarchy by making product titles larger than descriptions and using contrasting colors for price and 'Add to Cart' buttons to draw attention to key decision points.

For detailed information about the optimizations, refer to the Optimization Review file.
